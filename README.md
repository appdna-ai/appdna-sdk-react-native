# AppDNA SDK for React Native

The official React Native SDK for [AppDNA](https://appdna.ai) — the growth console for subscription apps.

> ⚠️ **Proprietary software.** A Commercial Agreement with AppDNA AI, Inc. is required to use this SDK. See [LICENSE](./LICENSE) and [NOTICE.md](./NOTICE.md).
>
> **Migrating from MIT-licensed v1.0.1 or earlier?** See [DEPRECATION_NOTICE.md](./DEPRECATION_NOTICE.md). MIT versions stop receiving server support after **15 May 2026**.

## What it does

AppDNA gives you a single drop-in SDK for the growth surfaces every subscription app needs, on both iOS and Android from one TypeScript codebase:

- **Analytics & events** — track user behavior with batched, offline-resilient delivery.
- **Experiments & feature flags** — server-driven A/B tests with deterministic variant assignment.
- **Paywalls** — render console-designed paywall layouts with native StoreKit 2 / Google Play Billing.
- **Onboarding flows** — multi-step onboarding with form inputs, async hooks, conditional branching, and rich media.
- **Surveys & feedback** — NPS, CSAT, free text, multi-choice with scheduling and frequency caps.
- **In-app messages** — modal, banner, fullscreen messages with audience targeting.
- **Push notifications** — rich content, action buttons, deep links, and delivery analytics.
- **Web entitlements & deep links** — server-validated entitlements and deferred deep linking.

## Requirements

- **React Native `>=0.76.9 <0.77.0` with the New Architecture enabled.** (RN 0.77+ ships Kotlin 2.0,
  which this module's Compose config does not yet support — a follow-up.) The SDK ships a TurboModule and a
  Fabric component; there is no legacy-bridge fallback, and it will not link on the old architecture.
- React 18.0+
- iOS 16.0+ (when targeting iOS)
- Android API 24+ (when targeting Android)

> **Versions 1.0.6 and earlier shipped no podspec and no Android Gradle module** and could not be
> linked into an app at all. Install `1.0.7` or later.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @appdna-ai/react-native-sdk
# or
yarn add @appdna-ai/react-native-sdk
```

For iOS, install the pods with the New Architecture switched on:

```bash
cd ios && RCT_NEW_ARCH_ENABLED=1 pod install && cd ..
```

On Android, set `newArchEnabled=true` in `android/gradle.properties`.

**Expo:** the package ships a config plugin — add `"plugins": ["@appdna-ai/react-native-sdk"]` to
`app.json` and run `npx expo prebuild`. Expo Go cannot host a native module; use a development build.

## Quick start

```typescript
import { AppDNA } from '@appdna-ai/react-native-sdk';

// Positional args: apiKey, environment, options. The environment is 'production' | 'sandbox'.
await AppDNA.configure('adn_live_xxx', 'production', { logLevel: 'warning' });
```

Track an event (fire-and-forget — it returns `void`, not a Promise):

```typescript
AppDNA.track('subscription_viewed', { plan_id: 'premium_monthly' });
```

Identify a user (after sign-in):

```typescript
await AppDNA.identify('user-123', { plan: 'premium' });
```

Present a paywall. Presentation and its outcome are two different things: `present()` resolves once
the paywall is on screen, and what the user then does arrives on the delegate.

```typescript
import { AppDNA, type AppDNAPaywallDelegate } from '@appdna-ai/react-native-sdk';

const delegate: AppDNAPaywallDelegate = {
  onPaywallPresented: () => {},
  onPaywallAction: () => {},
  onPaywallPurchaseStarted: () => {},
  onPaywallPurchaseCompleted: (paywallId, productId) => console.log('Purchased', productId),
  // `error` is a message string, and `errorType` is the stable reason code
  // (userCancelled | networkError | serverError | …). `productId` is null if none was selected.
  onPaywallPurchaseFailed: (paywallId, error, errorType) => console.log('Failed:', errorType, error),
  onPaywallRestoreStarted: () => {},
  onPaywallRestoreCompleted: () => {},
  onPaywallRestoreFailed: () => {},
  onPostPurchaseDeepLink: () => {},
  onPostPurchaseNextStep: () => {},
  onPaywallDismissed: () => {},
};

AppDNA.paywall.setDelegate(delegate);
await AppDNA.paywall.present('default', { placement: 'settings' });
```
