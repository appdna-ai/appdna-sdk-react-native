/**
 * SPEC-070-B §5 / §5.1 — the pending-veto map for the host-veto wire protocol.
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all
 *
 * Native awaits a host veto **forever** — there is no timeout in the SDK. Flutter's invoker gets
 * correlation for free (every `invokeMethod` carries its own private reply port) and robustness for
 * free (`suspendCancellableCoroutine` inside `withTimeout`). React Native's native→JS path is
 * **one-way**, so a veto must be emitted as `{callbackId, hook, argsJson}` and answered by an
 * explicit `respondToHostCallback(callbackId, resultJson)` call back into native.
 *
 * That reintroduces by hand four things Flutter never had to build, and this class is where each
 * lives. They are requirements, not niceties:
 *
 *   1. **A double-resolve guard.** A late or duplicate reply for a timed-out id is DROPPED.
 *   2. **Eviction on timeout**, or the map grows without bound — one leak per vetoed surface.
 *   3. **Reload-safe, namespaced ids.** The native module survives a JS reload: in-flight ids
 *      orphan, JS's pending map is gone while native still waits, and a recycled counter COLLIDES.
 *      Ids carry a per-process epoch, and [invalidateAll] clears the map on teardown (E11).
 *   4. **Per-hook defaults and per-hook wire shapes.** Seven hooks default to *allow*;
 *      `onPromoCodeSubmit` defaults to **reject**. A uniform default-on-timeout silently starts
 *      accepting unvalidated promo codes. The onboarding hooks answer with a map; the three vetoes
 *      answer with a bare bool — one `resultJson` envelope must preserve the distinction.
 *
 * ## W10 hardening (AC-39)
 *   - An unknown or foreign `callbackId` is **ignored, never thrown** — a reply from a previous JS
 *     epoch is expected, not exceptional.
 *   - The map is **count-bounded** as well as time-bounded: a burst can balloon it inside the
 *     five-second window.
 *
 * The timer itself is deliberately NOT here — it belongs to the caller, which knows the hook's
 * default. It is never a JS `setTimeout`: that is throttled when backgrounded and destroyed by a
 * Metro reload, and native would then await forever (E5).
