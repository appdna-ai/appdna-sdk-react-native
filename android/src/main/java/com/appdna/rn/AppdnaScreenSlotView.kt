/**
 * SPEC-070-B P4 — the Android host view for a server-driven AppDNA screen slot.
 *
 * A `FrameLayout` wrapping a `ComposeView` that renders the native `@Composable AppDNAScreenSlot`.
 * Height is not measured by Yoga (a Fabric host view has no intrinsic size without a C++ shadow
 * node — an ADR-001 violation), so this view measures its own content and reports it to JS through
 * `onContentSizeChange`; the `AppDNAScreenSlot` facade applies the height.
 *
 * ## The ViewTreeLifecycleOwner crash (reused from Flutter 070-C)
 *
 * `ComposeView.setContent {}` throws *"ViewTreeLifecycleOwner not found"* unless the view tree has a
 * `LifecycleOwner` + `SavedStateRegistryOwner` + `ViewModelStoreOwner`. A React Native host activity
 * is not guaranteed to provide them where this view is attached, so a plugin-owned owner is driven
 * to RESUMED and wired onto the ComposeView BEFORE `setContent`. Identical shim to
 * `AppDNAScreenSlotViewFactory.kt` in the Flutter plugin.

     * bridge every frame.
     *
     * ## Why this must MEASURE and not read `contentView.height`
     *
     * It used to report `composeView.width/height` — the child's LAID-OUT size. That made the slot a
     * height fixed-point and it was permanently blank:
     *
     *  - `contentView` is a MATCH_PARENT child of this FrameLayout;
     *  - Fabric lays THIS view out to exactly the height Yoga computed, and Yoga computes it from the
     *    JS `height` style — which `AppDNAScreenSlot.tsx` sets to `measuredHeight ?? minHeight`, i.e.
     *    to whatever we last reported;
     *  - so `contentView.height == this.height == the height we last emitted`.
     *
     * Steady state: emit 0 → JS sets 0 → next layout measures 0 → emit 0, forever. With
     * `minHeight={120}` it reported 120 regardless of the content. The content's own size never
     * entered the loop.
     *
     * So the content is measured UNCONSTRAINED in the vertical axis, at the width actually available —
     * the same contract as iOS, which fits its SwiftUI content with `systemLayoutSizeFitting` at
     * `.required` horizontal / `.fittingSizeLevel` vertical priority
     * (`ios/AppdnaScreenSlotHostView.swift`).
     */
    /**
     * 🔴 MEASURING IN `onLayout` ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH — NOTHING EVER CALLS IT AGAIN.
     *
     * This view's `onLayout` is invoked by its PARENT, and its parent is a React view:
     *
     *     // ReactViewGroup.java:217
     *     protected void onLayout(boolean changed, int l, int t, int r, int b) {
     *         // No-op since UIManagerModule handles actually laying out children.
     *     }
     *
     * So when Compose finishes composing the real content and calls `requestLayout()`, the traversal
     * runs, the React parent lays out NOTHING, and our `onLayout` never fires. It re-fires only when
     * Fabric mounts new layout metrics — i.e. only in response to a height WE emitted.
     *
     * The consequence, on the normal path: `AppDNAScreenSlot` loads its config asynchronously, so the
     * first (and only) measure sees the loading shimmer — a fixed 100dp. We emit 100, JS applies 100,
     * we dedupe, and we go quiet. The real 340dp content then composes and we never hear about it. The
     * slot displays a 100dp window onto the screen, forever. Same for every later content change: an
     * image finishing, a server-driven expand, content shrinking.
     *
     * `requestLayout()` is the re-entry point Compose actually calls, so that is where we hook. Posting
     * our own measure+layout pass is the standard RN escape hatch for a self-measuring child.
     */
    /**
     * The re-entry point, and it took three attempts to find one that actually fires.
     *
     * ① `onLayout` alone is not enough: this view's `onLayout` is called by its PARENT, and the parent
     *    is a React view — `ReactViewGroup.onLayout` is literally `// No-op since UIManagerModule
     *    handles actually laying out children.` So when Compose composes the real content, our
     *    `onLayout` never runs. The slot measures the loading shimmer once and freezes there.
     * ② Overriding `requestLayout()` does not fire either: `View.requestLayout()` propagates to the
     *    parent only `if (!mParent.isLayoutRequested())`, and during a pending traversal it already is
     *    — so the call is swallowed before it reaches us.
     * ③ A pre-draw listener always runs. Compose cannot change what is on screen without a draw, so
     *    this cannot be missed. The dedupe below makes it nearly free: an unchanged content is a
     *    measure-cache hit and reports nothing.
