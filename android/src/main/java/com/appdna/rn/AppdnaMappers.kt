/**
 * SPEC-070-B P1 — DTO → bridge-safe map mappers.
 *
 * The old shim called `.toMap()` on `List<String>` (from `restorePurchases()`) and on
 * `TransactionInfo`. Neither has such a method. Those calls could never have compiled, and RN's CI
 * — `npm install` + `tsc` — never compiles Kotlin, so nothing said so.
 *
 * ## The reconciled wire shape (N11)
 *
 * The two natives disagree, and neither is a superset:
 *   - iOS `Entitlement`     = `{identifier, isActive, expiresAt, productId}`
 *   - Android `Entitlement` = `{productId, store, status, expiresAt, isTrial, offerType}`
 *
 * Ruling: **union, with the platform-specific fields omitted rather than faked.** An absent key
 * means "this platform does not know it"; it never means `false` or `""`. `isActive` is synthesised
 * here from `status`, because a host asking "does this user have access" must not have to learn the
 * Play status vocabulary. `identifier` mirrors `productId`: Android has no separate identifier, and
 * inventing one would be worse than aliasing an honest value.
 *
 * Dates cross as ISO-8601 strings on both platforms — Android already stores them that way.
