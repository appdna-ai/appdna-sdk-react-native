 * Extends the CODEGEN'D [NativeAppdnaModuleSpec] rather than `ReactContextBaseJavaModule`, so a
 * method that exists in `src/specs/NativeAppdnaModule.ts` but not here is a COMPILE error, and vice
 * versa. Before this, `supportedEvents()` returned exactly two names while ~30 JS listeners waited
 * on emitters that did not exist, and every `setDelegate` was a silent no-op.
 *
 * ## Threading (E10) — load-bearing
 *
 * TurboModule methods execute on the **JS thread**, and `getMethodQueue()` is ignored. So a native
 * call that blocks — `AppDNA.presentOnboarding` posts to the main looper and then
 * `latch.await(5, SECONDS)` when called off-main — would freeze rendering, timers, and every other
 * call for five seconds. Present-style calls are therefore dispatched onto the **UI thread**, where
 * native's own `Looper.myLooper() == mainLooper` check takes the latch-free path.
