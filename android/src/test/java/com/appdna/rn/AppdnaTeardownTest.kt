/**
 * SPEC-070-B E6 — teardown must not abandon anything it was in the middle of.
 *
 * `invalidate()` calls `scope.cancel()`. A cancelled coroutine does not run the rest of its body, so
 * before this every in-flight `configure` / `purchase` / `getProducts` / `restorePurchases` died
 * WITHOUT `promise.reject` — and a JS promise that is neither resolved nor rejected hangs its `await`
 * for the life of the process. A Metro reload mid-purchase left the host's checkout spinner turning,
 * forever, with no error anywhere to say why.
 *
 * The same scope carries the `onPromoCodeSubmit` veto, whose `completion` native is BLOCKING on: kill
 * the scope and the promo field spins for ever too. Its safe default is REJECT (a code nobody
 * validated is not a valid code), and that is what every abandonment path must now answer with.
 *
 * Robolectric's looper is PAUSED, so a coroutine launched on `Dispatchers.Main` is queued and does
 * not run until the looper is idled. Never idling it is exactly the "in flight" state under test —
 * and it is deterministic, not a sleep.
