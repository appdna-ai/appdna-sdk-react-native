/**
 * SPEC-070-B AC-3 — the anti-"bridged-but-dead" evidence pass, Android half.
 *
 * ## The bug class
 *
 * 070-C's DOMINANT defect was not "the method is wrong". It was **"the method is bridged and nothing
 * ever calls it"** — a delegate that never fired, an event nobody emitted, a parameter silently
 * dropped. Every one of those passes a compile, passes `check:rn-facade-parity` (which proves the
 * method EXISTS in the IR, in Kotlin, in Swift, in the ObjC++ adapter and in the TS spec), and passes
 * a jest suite that mocks native away. Existence is not reachability, and until now nothing in this
 * repo asserted the difference.
 *
 * AC-3 asks for the assertion: an EVIDENCE set, recorded by actually running the code, that must
 * equal the MANIFEST set, extracted from the sources. Any gap is named.
 *
 * ## Why this is reflective, and why that is the point
 *
 * The method list is not typed out here. It is read off the CLASS — every `override fun` the module
 * declares — and each one is invoked on a real `AppdnaModule` instance with synthesised arguments. A
 * hand-written list of 55 calls would be a second manifest, drifting from the first, and the fifty-
 * sixth method would simply never be added to it. That is the same failure one level up.
 *
 * ## What counts as REACHED
 *
 * A method is reached when its BODY RAN. Two signals, and both are proof:
 *
 *   - it settled its promise (resolve or reject) — the body ran to completion; or
 *   - it threw, and the stack trace has a frame inside `com.appdna.rn.AppdnaModule` or, better,
 *     inside `ai.appdna.sdk` — i.e. it got as far as the SDK singleton. The SDK is unconfigured here,
 *     so plenty of calls throw; a throw FROM INSIDE is evidence, not absence. What is NOT evidence is
 *     an `AbstractMethodError` or a `NoSuchMethodError` — the signature of a method that is declared
 *     and not implemented, which is precisely the corpse this pass hunts.
 *
 * Void methods (`track`, `setLogLevel`, `notifyScreenAppeared`, `suppressMessages`,
 * `respondToHostCallback`) have no promise; returning normally is the body running to completion.
 *
 * ## Events
 *
 * All 41 are driven through the REAL `emitEventNamed` dispatch. Its `else` branch throws
 * `IllegalStateException("no TurboModule emitter for event …")` — so an event whose `when` branch is
 * missing is *distinguishable* from one whose branch exists but whose emitter needs a live JS bridge
 * (that one throws from inside the codegen'd base class, which is evidence the branch was taken).
 *
 * The evidence is written to `handler-pass-android.json` at the repo root and checked by
 * `scripts/check-rn-handler-evidence.ts`, which fails on any manifest entry with no evidence.
