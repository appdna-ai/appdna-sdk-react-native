/**
 * SPEC-070-B W15–W21 / AC-37 — the performance budgets, as numbers in CI.
 *
 * AC-37 asks for budgets that are "**numbers in CI, not vibes**", and the distinction it is drawing is
 * between a measurement and a constant. Two of the six existed (app size, ScreenSlot layout shift).
 * The other four — cold-start, veto latency, `configure()` JS-thread time, memory — had **zero hits
 * repo-wide**. This file is the four, minus the one that genuinely cannot be measured here.
 *
 * ## The rules this file holds itself to
 *
 * 1. **Every number is measured.** Not one assertion compares a constant to itself. Where a default
 *    is involved the oracle is the production code, never a literal copied beside it.
 * 2. **The budget lives in `.ai/sdk-perf-budgets.json`, not in this file.** A budget in the test is a
 *    number that moves whenever the test is edited, which is to say it is not a budget. Raising one
 *    is a reviewed edit to that file.
 * 3. **What cannot be measured is SAID, not faked.** The end-to-end cold-start TTI delta needs an app
 *    launch on a device; a JVM harness has no app, no frame, and no first frame to time. It is
 *    declared in the JSON's `_deferred` block with its reason. [bridgeModuleInit] measures the
 *    component of cold start the WRAPPER actually owns and can regress — the honest subset.
 *
 * ## Why these run under Robolectric on the JS-thread analogue
 *
 * A TurboModule method executes on the JS thread (E10). The JUnit thread is that thread's stand-in:
 * what a method does *before returning* is exactly what it would do to JS. That is a real measurement
 * of the property W15 is about, on the real code, with no device required.
