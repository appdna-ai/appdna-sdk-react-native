/**
 * SPEC-070-B AC-24 — the React Native **integration** fixture runner.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists, and what AC-24 originally asked for
 *
 * AC-24 asks that "the RN runner asserts against `expect`, not the bridge call shape". At the JEST
 * level that is **not achievable, and not because it is hard**. Per ADR-001 the RN TS layer is a THIN
 * WRAPPER: no rendering, no business logic, no storage. In a jest test the native module is MOCKED
 * AWAY, so the only thing on the JS side of the boundary is the call. A fixture's `expect` block
 * asserts NATIVE behaviour — an audience rule evaluated, a DTO parsed, an event envelope built, a
 * step advanced — and none of that exists in the wrapper. Asking jest to assert it would only ever be
 * satisfied by re-implementing the SDK inside the test and asserting the mirror, which is precisely
 * the fiction the fixture-suite post-mortem was written about.
 *
 * The coverage a wrapper CAN honestly provide is one level down: drive the fixture through the REAL
 * bridged `AppdnaModule` method — the same one the JS facade calls — into the REAL, configured native
 * `AppDNA` singleton, and assert the fixture's `expect` block against what NATIVE actually did. That
 * is this file. `__tests__/sharedFixtures.test.ts` keeps the jest leg (facade → correct bridge call,
 * correct args); this leg proves the call, once it lands, produces the behaviour the fixture pins.
 *
 * Nothing here re-implements the SDK. Every assertion reads an SDK OUTPUT:
 *
 *   - **events** — the envelopes the native `EventQueue` actually persisted, read out of the SDK's OWN
 *     `EventDatabase` (the one its queue is writing to — asked for, never guessed at). The wrapper
 *     configures with `batchSize = 0` (its own bridged option), so nothing is uploaded and the store
 *     is the truth-of-record.
 *   - **delegate_calls** — captured at the JS BOUNDARY. The generated `NativeAppdnaModuleSpec`'s
 *     `emitOnX` methods all funnel into `BaseJavaModule.mEventEmitterCallback`, and that field is
 *     replaced here with a recorder. So the path native-SDK-delegate → forwarder → `emitEventNamed` →
 *     codegen'd emitter → JS is exercised END TO END, and what is recorded is exactly the `(name,
 *     payload)` a JS listener would receive.
 *   - **state_after** — bridged getters (`getUserTraits`), the value the bridged promise resolved
 *     (`presentPaywallByPlacement` → Boolean), the Activity the SDK actually started, or the SDK's own
 *     envelope. Never an echo of the fixture's input: `assertExpectations` FAILS on a `state_after`
 *     key no observer produced, so a vacuous assertion is impossible.
 *
 * Plus one invariant no other runner can assert: every envelope produced while driven through this
 * wrapper must carry `device.framework == "react_native"` (SPEC-070-B §7). On iOS/Android core it is
 * `native`; if the wrapper ever stopped injecting it, every RN event would land in BigQuery
 * mis-attributed and nothing would error.
 *
 * ## Which fixtures the wrapper can drive — and why the rest are native-only
 *
 * A wrapper's bridged surface IS the host's API surface. So the fixtures it can drive end-to-end are
 * exactly those whose `action` is a HOST API CALL. A host cannot "tap a button" inside a native
 * onboarding step, cannot hand the SDK a raw FCM payload (its own `FirebaseMessagingService` does),
 * cannot ask the SDK to evaluate a bare audience rule set or interpolate a template — those are not
 * API, they are internals reached only from inside a native render/decision path. That is a
 * STRUCTURAL boundary drawn by ADR-001, not a gap in this runner, and it is recorded, fixture by
 * fixture, in `scripts/check-fixture-coverage.ts` (`RN_NATIVE_ONLY`) — a decision, not a deletion.
 *
 * ## No skips
 *
 * A fixture that claims `rn` and reaches [unsupported] FAILS. There is no skiplist and no soft-skip;
 * `pnpm check:fixture-runner-skips` enforces that statically, and this runner is registered with it.
 *
 * ## The singleton, and the two traps it set
 *
 * `AppDNA` is a PROCESS-GLOBAL whose `configure()` is honoured exactly once — and Robolectric hands
 * every test method a FRESH files dir, while the SDK keeps using whichever one it was configured
 * under. Both traps below produced a runner that passed alone and failed for the next reader:
 *
 *   1. A PARAMETERIZED runner (one method per fixture) configured the SDK during fixture #1 and then
 *      read an empty store for #2 and #3 — the SDK was still writing into dir-1. Fixed by running the
 *      fixtures inside ONE method, against ONE configure, in a stable dir. Each fixture is isolated
 *      from the last by the SDK's own bridged `reset()`, a cleared paywall cache and a cleared event
 *      store, and every failure is reported, not just the first.
 *   2. READING THE STORE BY PATH (`File(noBackupFilesDir, "appdna_events.db")`) worked when this class
 *      ran alone and reported "native emitted []" for every fixture the moment ANY other test class
 *      configured the SDK first. Fixed by asking the SDK where its database is instead of reasoning
 *      about it — see [eventDatabase].
