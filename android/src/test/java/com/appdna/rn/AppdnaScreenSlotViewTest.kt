/**
 * SPEC-070-B P4 — the height contract of [AppdnaScreenSlotView].
 *
 * There was no Android test for the slot, and that is precisely why it shipped as a HEIGHT FIXED
 * POINT. `AppDNAScreenSlot.tsx` drives the host's height from JS
 * (`style={{ height: measuredHeight ?? minHeight }}`) using what native reports, so native reporting
 * its own laid-out height reported the number JS had just given it — a closed loop that the content's
 * real size never entered. The slot rendered at `minHeight` (default 0: permanently blank) forever.
 *
 * These tests assert what native must report is the CONTENT's height, measured unconstrained at the
 * available width — the same contract iOS gets from `systemLayoutSizeFitting(.fittingSizeLevel)`.
 *
 * ## Falsification
 *
 * Restore the old body of `onLayout` —
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val contentHeight = composeView.height   // the LAID-OUT height, i.e. the host's
 * ```
 *
 * — and [reportsContentHeightNotHostHeight] and [reportsContentHeightNotMinHeightWhenContentIsTaller]
 * both fail with `expected:<300> but was:<40>` / `<120>`: the old code echoes the host height back.

     * Stands in for the ComposeView. Behaves exactly as any real content view does:

     *  - under an EXACTLY height spec it takes the height it is GIVEN — this is what a MATCH_PARENT
     *    child of the Fabric host does, and it is what made the old implementation echo the host's
     *    height straight back to JS;
     *  - under UNSPECIFIED it reports its own INTRINSIC height;
     *  - and changing that intrinsic height invalidates it. `View.measure` is backed by a measure
     *    cache keyed on the spec pair, and `requestLayout()` is what clears it — so content that
     *    resized without calling it would be measured from the stale cache. Every real view
     *    (ComposeView included) requests layout when its content changes; a fake that did not would
     *    be testing a situation Android cannot produce.
