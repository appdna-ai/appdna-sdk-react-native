/**
 * SPEC-070-B E10 — a `ReadableArray` may only be read on the thread the bridge delivered it on.
 *
 * `configure` and `presentPaywall` both parse their `ReadableMap` BEFORE dispatching, and both say so
 * in a comment. `getProducts` did not: it read the `ReadableArray` INSIDE `scope.launch`, i.e. after
 * the method had already returned, from a coroutine — the one place in the module that violated its
 * own stated invariant. The bridge is free to recycle the backing buffer by then, so
 * `getProducts([...])` could query the store with a garbled or empty id list and resolve `[]` with no
 * error anywhere. A bug that only shows up under memory pressure, on a device, in production.
 *
 * The assertion is the THREAD the array is read on — the property the invariant is about — and it is
 * deterministic: Robolectric's looper is PAUSED, so a coroutine queued on `Dispatchers.Main` has not
 * run when `getProducts` returns. Had the read stayed inside the launch, nothing would have touched
 * the array at all by the time the assertions run.
