/**
 * SPEC-070-B W15 / AC-37 — `configure()` must not run on the JS thread.
 *
 * A TurboModule method body executes on the JS THREAD on Android (E10), and `AppDNA.configure` opens
 * SQLite, reads SharedPreferences and warms the config cache. Running that inline stalls JS at app
 * start — exactly when the JS thread is busiest and a stall is most visible. iOS is already safe
 * (its `configure` hops onto a utility queue internally); Android was not.
 *
 * The assertion is the THREAD the promise settles on, not a stopwatch. A millisecond budget would be
 * flaky on shared CI hardware, while "did the work leave the caller's thread" is exactly the property
 * W15 asks for and is deterministic: had `configure` run inline, it could only have settled on the
 * calling thread.
 *
 * Whether native configure SUCCEEDS here is irrelevant — a reject records the thread just as a
 * resolve does, and the threading contract is what is under test. The promise is a Mockito mock with
 * a catch-all Answer rather than a hand-written stub: `Promise` has ten `reject` overloads, and a
 * stub that misses one stops compiling every time RN adds another.
