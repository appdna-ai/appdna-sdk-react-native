/**
 * SPEC-070-B §5 / §5.1 — the pending-veto map for the host-veto wire protocol (iOS).
 *
 * Native awaits a host veto **forever** — the SDK has no timeout. Flutter gets correlation for free
 * (each `invokeMethod` carries its own private reply port) and robustness for free
 * (`SyncCallbackInvoker` guards `continuation.resume` with a `resumed` flag on the main queue).
 * React Native's native→JS path is **one-way**, so a veto is emitted as `{callbackId, hook,
 * argsJson}` and answered by an explicit `respondToHostCallback(callbackId, resultJson)`.
 *
 * That reintroduces by hand the four things Flutter never had to build:
 *
 *   1. **A double-resolve guard.** A late or duplicate reply for a timed-out id is DROPPED.
 *   2. **Eviction on timeout**, or the map grows unbounded — one leak per vetoed surface.
 *   3. **Reload-safe, namespaced ids.** The native module survives a JS reload: in-flight ids
 *      orphan, JS's pending map is gone while native still waits, and a recycled counter COLLIDES.
 *      Ids carry a per-process epoch, and [invalidateAll] clears the map on teardown (E11).
 *   4. **Per-hook defaults and per-hook wire shapes.** Seven hooks default to *allow*;
 *      `onPromoCodeSubmit` defaults to **reject**. A uniform default-on-timeout silently starts
 *      accepting unvalidated promo codes.
 *
 * W10 (AC-39): an unknown or foreign `callbackId` is **ignored, never raised** — a reply from a
 * previous JS epoch is expected, not exceptional — and the map is **count-bounded** as well as
 * time-bounded, because a burst can balloon it inside the five-second window.
 *
 * The timer is deliberately NOT here: it belongs to the caller, which knows the hook's default. It
 * is never a JS `setTimeout` — that is throttled when backgrounded and destroyed by a Metro reload,
 * and native would then await forever (E5).
