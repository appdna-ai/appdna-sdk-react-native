/**
 * SPEC-070-B P4 — the Swift half of the iOS ScreenSlot Fabric component.
 *
 * ## Why a Swift half exists
 *
 * The Fabric host view MUST be an ObjC++ `RCTViewComponentView` — that is where the C++
 * ComponentDescriptor, props and event emitter live. But the thing being embedded is
 * `AppDNAScreenSlot`, a SwiftUI `View`, which ObjC++ cannot name (SwiftUI types are not `@objc`). So
 * this `UIView` hosts the SwiftUI slot and exposes a plain `@objc` surface — `slotName` and an
 * `onContentSize` callback — that `AppdnaScreenSlotView.mm` drives. Same split as the TurboModule
 * adapter, for the same reason.
 *
 * ## The `UIHostingController` leak (reused from Flutter 070-C)
 *
 * A bare `UIHostingController` with no parent deallocates as soon as creation returns — its SwiftUI
 * `@State` and `.onAppear` never run and the slot renders nothing. It is therefore held strongly AND
 * attached as a child of the nearest ancestor view controller once in the window; on teardown it is
 * explicitly detached (`willMove(toParent: nil)` + `removeFromParent()`), or every mount/unmount
 * leaks one hosting controller for the app session.
