 * SPEC-070-B E2 — encode a value of unknown shape as JSON.

 * `getRemoteConfig`, `getFeatureVariant` and `getExperimentConfig` can each return a bool, a number,
 * a string, an array or an object. There is no codegen type for "any JSON value", so the value
 * crosses as a JSON **string** and is parsed in the facade. This is also the only encoding whose
 * meaning is identical on both platforms — Android's mirror is `AppdnaBridge.toJson`.
 *
 * `JSONSerialization` refuses a bare scalar unless `.fragmentsAllowed` is set, which is exactly the
 * case that matters here: a boolean flag is the common one.
