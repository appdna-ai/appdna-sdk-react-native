/**
 SPEC-070-B AC-3 — the anti-"bridged-but-dead" evidence pass, iOS half.

 ## The bug class, restated because it is the one that keeps happening

 070-C's DOMINANT defect was not a wrong signature. It was **"the method is bridged and nothing ever
 calls it"** — a delegate that never fired, an event nobody emitted, a parameter silently dropped. Each
 of those compiles, satisfies `check:rn-facade-parity` (which proves the method EXISTS in the IR, in
 Kotlin, in Swift, in the ObjC++ adapter and in the TS spec), and passes a jest suite that mocks native
 away. **Existence is not reachability.** Only running the code tells the two apart, and this branch
 found three more of them.

 ## Why the 55 calls are written out, when the Android half reflects

 Because the safety is in the GATE, not in the list. `scripts/check-rn-handler-evidence.ts` extracts
 the manifest from the SOURCES — every `@objc(...)` selector in AppdnaModuleImpl.swift — and demands
 an evidence row for each. Forget a call here and the gate names the method that has no evidence. So an
 explicit list cannot silently drift: it can only fail loudly. (Swift cannot do what the Kotlin half
 does anyway — `NSInvocation` is unavailable in Swift, so a reflective pass over selectors of varying
 arity is not expressible.)

 ## What counts as REACHED

 The method's body ran. For the 50 methods that take a promise pair, that means the promise SETTLED —
 resolved or rejected, either one proves the body ran to completion. `returned normally` is deliberately
 NOT accepted for them, because an empty override returns normally too:

     @objc(getProducts:resolve:reject:)
     public func getProducts(_ ids: NSArray, resolve: ..., reject: ...) { }   // ← bridged, dead

 …and that is the corpse. A promise that never settles is also the E6 defect in its own right: a JS
 `await` on it hangs for the life of the process. The five void methods (`track`, `setLogLevel`,
 `notifyScreenAppeared`, `suppressMessages`, `respondToHostCallback`) have no promise to settle;
 returning is all they can do.

 ## Events are not here, and that is stated rather than hidden

 The ObjC++ `emitEventNamed:` table dispatches to the codegen'd `emitOnX:`, which calls a C++
 `EventEmitterCallback` that the React runtime installs. An XCTest has no React runtime, so that
 callback is an empty `std::function` and invoking it is a hard crash — not a test. The iOS event table
 is covered statically by `check:rn-facade-parity` (bidirectionally) plus the `RCTAssert(NO)`
 fall-through in AppdnaModule.mm, and at runtime by the AC-2 device pass. The gate prints this limit on
 every run, because an exclusion nobody can see is how a gate starts lying.
