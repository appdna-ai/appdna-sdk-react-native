/// 🔴 A FAILING AUTH BACKEND WAS AN UNLOCKED DOOR.
///
/// Native refuses to advance a credential step when no delegate can handle it. A WRAPPER always
/// attaches a delegate, so that gate never fires for React Native — the wrapper has to re-make the
/// decision by asking JS. It did, and it blocked on ONE answer: `{"__appdna_unhandled":true}`, the
/// sentinel meaning "no handler registered".
///
/// But a host that HAS a handler can still fail to answer, in three ways, and every one of them
/// replies `"null"` — the wire form of "no opinion, apply your default":
///
///   1. the handler THREW (the JS dispatcher catches it and answers NO_OPINION);
///   2. its promise REJECTED — which is exactly what happens when the host's own sign-in call fails:
///      backend 500, no network, expired token;
///   3. it exceeded `vetoTimeout` (default 5s) — a SLOW auth backend.
///
/// And native's default for a step advance is `.proceed`. So the fix that stopped a NO-handler host
/// walking past a credential step did nothing for the far more common case: a host that implements
/// auth properly, whose auth is simply DOWN. Tap "Continue with email", the sign-in errors, and the
/// SDK lets the user into the app.
///
/// The wrapper's own comment said native's default was "the conservative answer for each hook —
/// reject for a promo code, allow for the rest". For a credential step, allow is not conservative.
///
/// An auth action now advances only on an EXPLICIT host decision. Silence is not consent.
