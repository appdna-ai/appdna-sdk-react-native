/**
 SPEC-070-B AC-30b / AC-7 — `onPromoCodeSubmit`'s default is **REJECT**, on iOS.

 ## Why this test exists

 Seven of the eight veto hooks default to *allow* on a silent host: a host that registered no handler,
 or answered too slowly, should not be able to break an onboarding flow. `onPromoCodeSubmit` is the
 eighth and it is the opposite — and the asymmetry is not decorative. §11.7 is a LIVE defect on both
 natives: a paywall with no delegate ran a *"basic non-empty check fallback"* that marked **any
 non-blank string** as a valid promo code, printed "Code applied!", and folded it into the purchase
 metadata under a comment reading *"fold validated promo code into purchase metadata"*. The store
 price is set by `productId` so there was no store-side discount — but a host backend that trusts that
 metadata field applies a discount nobody validated.

 A timeout, an unregistered hook, a saturated pending map, and a host that answers `null` all mean the
 same thing: **the host did not validate this code.** The only safe reading of that is *invalid*.

 Nothing asserted this on iOS. Android's equivalent is proven in `AppdnaTeardownTest`; Swift had no
 test target at all, so the one hook whose default is a security property was checked on exactly one
 of the two platforms it ships on.

 Each case drives the REAL `AppdnaVetoInvoker` + the REAL `PaywallForwarder` — the objects
 `registerDelegates` actually installs — not a re-implementation of their logic.
