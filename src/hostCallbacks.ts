/**
 * SPEC-070-B §5 / §5.1 — the JS half of the host-veto wire protocol.
 *
 * Flutter's `invokeMethod` carries its own private reply port, so a veto correlates for free. React
 * Native's native→JS path is **one-way**: native emits `onHostCallback` with `{callbackId, hook,
 * argsJson}` and waits for an explicit `respondToHostCallback(callbackId, resultJson)`.
 *
 * ## Where the timeout is, and is not
 *
 * The 5s timer lives in **native** (`AppdnaHostCallbacks` on both platforms), never here. A JS
 * `setTimeout` is throttled when the app is backgrounded and destroyed outright by a Metro reload
 * (E5); native would then await forever, and onboarding would hang on a blank step. Native also owns
 * the per-hook default — seven allow, `onPromoCodeSubmit` rejects — so a hook that throws or is
 * unregistered replies with a JSON `null`, meaning "no opinion", and native applies that default.
 *
 * ## The eight hooks
 *
 * Four onboarding hooks return a **map**; the promo hook and the three vetoes return a bare
 * **boolean**. The single `resultJson` envelope preserves the distinction because it is JSON: `null`,
 * `true` and `{"action":"block"}` are all legal top-level values.

 * The reply that means "this host registered NO handler for this hook" — as opposed to "the host

 * place, and that place is why the distinction has to exist:
 *
 * Native gates its AUTH actions (`email_login`, `login`, `request_otp`, …) on delegate presence — no
 * delegate means "nobody can sign this user in", so it stays on the step and shows an error. But a
 * WRAPPER always attaches a delegate at `configure()` (native starts emitting during configure, so it
 * must), and that delegate answers `.proceed` when JS has nothing to say. The result: React Native
 * ADVANCED PAST THE CREDENTIAL STEP WITHOUT AUTHENTICATING ANYONE, while native stayed put. The
 * delegate-presence check is a proxy for "will someone handle this", and for wrappers the proxy lies.
 *
 * This sentinel gives the wrapper's forwarder the fact it actually needs.
