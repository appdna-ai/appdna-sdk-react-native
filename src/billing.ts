/**
 * N11 — the wire shape is the **union** of the iOS and Android entitlement models, with the keys the
 * running platform has no concept of **omitted, never faked**. `isActive` is synthesised on Android
 * from `status`; dates cross as ISO-8601 strings.
 *
 * 🔴 This type used to declare `{productId, store, status, expiresAt, isTrial, offerType}` — all
 * REQUIRED — and it matched NEITHER mapper:
 *
 *   - iOS `AppdnaMappers.map(_ entitlement:)` emits `{identifier, productId, isActive, expiresAt?}`.
 *   - Android `AppdnaMappers.map(entitlement)` emits that plus `store`, `status`, `isTrial`,
 *     `offerType?`.
 *
 * `identifier` and `isActive` — the two keys BOTH platforms send, and the only ones a host can act on
 * cross-platform — were not on the type at all, so a host could not read them without a cast. And
 * `store` / `status` / `isTrial` / `offerType` were typed non-optional while being **absent** on iOS:
 * `if (e.status === 'active')` compiled and was ALWAYS FALSE there, and `e.expiresAt === null` never
 * fired on either platform, because a missing expiry is an OMITTED key (`undefined`), never `null`.
 *
 * The two mappers are not made to agree by faking: iOS's core `Entitlement` genuinely has no store /
 * status / trial / offer concept, and inventing `isTrial: false` for a user who IS in a trial is a
 * worse answer than "this platform does not know". So the TYPE now says what the wire says.
 *
 * **Ask `isActive`.** It is the cross-platform question, present on both, synthesised on Android from
 * the Play status vocabulary so a host never has to learn it.
