/**
 * SPEC-070-B D-q2 / D-c / §20 — the single place the native module is resolved.
 *
 * ## Why `TurboModuleRegistry`, and why no `NativeEventEmitter`
 *
 * D-c makes this package New Architecture only. Under the New Architecture the native side emits
 * through the codegen'd `emitOnX:` methods on `NativeAppdnaModuleSpecBase` (iOS) /
 * `NativeAppdnaModuleSpec` (Android), and JS receives through the `EventEmitter<T>` **properties**
 * on the spec — `AppdnaModule.onPaywallDismissed(listener)`. That path never touches
 * `RCTEventEmitter`, so `new NativeEventEmitter(module).addListener(name, cb)` — what every
 * published version of this package did — subscribes to a channel nothing ever writes to. It does
 * not throw. It simply never fires, which is the worst possible failure mode for an analytics SDK.
 *
 * ## Why lazily
 *
 * `index.ts`, `billing.ts` and `push.ts` each used to resolve the module at MODULE SCOPE. On a
 * runtime without it — Expo Go, RN Web, or an app whose `pod install` never ran — that threw at
 * import, before any host code ran and before any error of ours could be raised. So the module is
 * resolved on first use. A host that imports this package on a platform where it never calls it
 * gets silence, which is the correct behavior.
