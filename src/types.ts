 * Worse is what happened if a host forced a bare `'adapty'` past the type: neither native matches it
 * (a bare string carries no apiKey, so it is deliberately REFUSED rather than run keyless), both fall
 * through to the default — and purchases are silently routed to StoreKit / Play Billing instead of
